If the Embody Elemental glyph is dispelled the Caster and Elemental die as the elemental materialises in the same space occupied by the caster. \n 3.

It may only be used for elements that the Wizard holds as a colour.  There is a 2 second period of disorientation on arrival exactly as per the Handbook 6mp Blue Glyph Blink. The wizard must have seen the destination before on this adventure, have the destination within line of sight, live there, i.e. a location not involved with the adventure which may be known as the wizard's home, or have memorised the location. It costs 5pts post 8th to memorise a location other than home, per location memorised. The referee of the location must have signed the ability onto your character card. If you have a location signed onto your card and are on an adventure not being run by the same referee who signed the location onto your card then he is within his rights to disallow that location as a point to which you may 'port to. In case of dispute the player is assumed to have teleported home. In other ways this glyph functions as per the Elemental Shift spell above.  Due to the stresses on the body caused by this glyph, casting damage for casting it a second time within a one hour period is calculated as if the glyph were three levels higher.  No additional mana is used.  This effect is cumulative, so a third use of the spell within an hour period would cause casting damage as an 18 mana glyph, and so on!","note":null,"special":null,"expertise":null}]}}}
