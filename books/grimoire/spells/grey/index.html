<td>Description</td>
<td colspan=5>This stackable glyph will grant the caster a boon form his Dragon or Drake. This takes the form in game terms equivalent to the innate powers granted to the elves / draves of the respective dragon / drake. Obviously only Elves and Draves with an established Mana Dragon or Drake may be pacted. Thus this may not be used to gain Drowe, Winter, Wood, Faerie nor Seasonal Elf innates.
The first rune grants 4 levels of elven innates, each additional rune will grant +1 level of innates.
Thus 5 runes will grant 8th level magical innates. Whilst active the caster may not recover the mana spent on this spell, without it ending the Pact early. This spell may only be learnt and cast once per colour held and a set of 5 runes comes for the price of 60pts - and should the Mage hold more than one, each colour must be learnt separately.
This spell can only grant one set of innates each day. It is not possible to cast it, use the innates, remove it, and recast it for a new set of innates.
The duration of the spell is based on the number of runes cast:
1 Rune – One Hour
2 Runes – Three Hours
3 Runes – Six Hours
4 Runes – Twelve Hours
5 Runes – Twenty Four Hours
It is not possible to cast this spell with greater than 5 runes.
This spell stacks with normal Elven innates but is not multiplied by x2/3 innates type abilities.</td>

<tr>
<td>Description</td>
<td colspan=5>Binds the power of a standard elemental to the current plane, so that its presence is more stable and it can utilise more of its elemental powers. The benefits of this stability are great:-
1) The elemental is not disrupted by coming into contact with another elemental, and cannot itself be disrupted in this way.
2) The elemental cannot be embodied. If this spell is cast upon an elemental which is currently embodied, this spell causes the target elemental to materialise within the body of the embodier, slaying both embodier and elemental.
3) The elemental cannot be destroyed with an elemental-destroying effect whilst this glyph is active, although it can be dispelled.
4) The elemental may carry objects that are magical or have been enchanted so that an elf may use them, although they may not use weapons or armour.
5) The elemental is immune to offensive effects/attacks based upon it's own element.
6) The elemental gains additional powers based upon it's native element. All these effects are non-dispellable except by dispelling the Bind Elemental:-
Sylph: May fly, as per the Walk on Air (Self) spell.
Gnome: Gains 1/2 effect sharp weapon blows.
Shade: Benefits from an Ally Darkness effect and causes Disintegrate (T) by blow.
Sprite: Radiates magical light, as per the Light (R) spell.
Undine: The undine can change it's shape and appearance upon the casting of this spell to anything that could reasonably be simulated using the Passive Illusion spell. This change is illusory but cannot be disbelieved, although True Sight and similar will reveal the undine for what it is. The statistics and powers of the undine do not change, and if the shape chosen is smaller than a halfling it may not inflict damage.
Salamander: Additionally Ignites all it touches, as per the Ignite (T) spell and inflicts additional magical fire damage as per the Fireblade spell. This is cumulative with other increases from Arm Elemental and similar spells.
The spell may be bought by any handbook wizard for their own colour of elemental. </td>

<td colspan=5>This spell transports the wizard from a spot immersed in the appropriate element to another similar point that the caster can see or is within 20'. It may only be used for elements that the Wizard holds as a colour. There is a 2 second period of disorientation on arrival exactly as per the Handbook 6mp Blue Glyph Blink. For example, a Red wizard in contact with a fire the size of a large bonfire could use this spell to Fire-Shift. In general, there must be a source of the appropriate element at each end of a size approximately equal to half the caster's size in the case of water, earth or fire. Air may be used whenever there is sufficient air to breathe. Shadow-shift may only be used in a circumstance where there is heavy shadow and no light-source within 5', and Light-shift only when the area is brightly lit or the caster is holding a light-source of candle-size or greater.</td>

<td>Description</td>
<td colspan=5>The wizard may embody an elemental 6 of their own colour that they have just summoned, this grants the following powers and no others:
1. The ability to shift at will as the appropriate elemental, to maximum range of 20' or line-of-sight.
2. The elemental sight possessed by the elemental - in other words, the ability to perceive elemental force of the elemental's colour, it's opposite colour, and 'other' colours, as well as using the wizard's normal sight. This does distinguish between magical and non-magical sources of the element.
Disadvantages: There are several disadvantages of embodying elementals as detailed below:
1. If the elemental is dispelled, destroyed or removed in any other fashion the caster dies.
2. If the Embody Elemental glyph is dispelled the Caster and Elemental die as the elemental materialises in the same space occupied by the caster.
3. If an elemental touches the wizard the wizard and the elemental vanish as they negate each other. The wizard's body will never be seen again.</td>

<td>Description</td>
<td colspan=5>This spell transports the wizard from a spot immersed in the appropriate element to another similar point on the same plane. It may only be used for elements that the Wizard holds as a colour. There is a 2 second period of disorientation on arrival exactly as per the Handbook 6mp Blue Glyph Blink. The wizard must have seen the destination before on this adventure, have the destination within line of sight, live there, i.e. a location not involved with the adventure which may be known as the wizard's home, or have memorised the location. It costs 5pts post 8th to memorise a location other than home, per location memorised. The referee of the location must have signed the ability onto your character card. If you have a location signed onto your card and are on an adventure not being run by the same referee who signed the location onto your card then he is within his rights to disallow that location as a point to which you may 'port to. In case of dispute the player is assumed to have teleported home. In other ways this glyph functions as per the Elemental Shift spell above. Due to the stresses on the body caused by this glyph, casting damage for casting it a second time within a one hour period is calculated as if the glyph were three levels higher. No additional mana is used. This effect is cumulative, so a third use of the spell within an hour period would cause casting damage as an 18 mana glyph, and so on!</td>
