<a class=anchor href=#3rd-edition-basic-handbook>#</a></h1><h2 id=introduction>Introduction
<a class=anchor href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>This book is divided up into two parts:</p><p>The first section deals with everything that you need to know to start to play in the Labyrinthe Live Role-playing environment and are all the basic rules that you are likely to need as you progress from a 1st Level novice up to an 8th Level seasoned mercenary. It tends to deal with the kind of thing that you are most likely to meet on your first few Adventures. The Classes and Races listed are those that we recommend that you familiarise yourself with and playbefore trying the more complex Classes. If once you have read through this and have quite a firm idea of what basicclass you want to play we would thoroughly suggest that you get hold of the relevant publication with the more in depthdetails relating to that class.</p><p>The second section is a reference for more experienced players who require information that may not be contained inother publications and also to give you a basic idea as to the beginnings of further character development andprogression.</p><h2 id=live-role-playing>Live Role-Playing
<a class=anchor href=#live-role-playing>#</a></h2><p>Live Role-playing is exactly what its name suggests - live. If you want to spot the monster hidden in the corner or sneakthrough a room in the dark you are going to have to keep your eyes open and watch where you are stepping. Yourcharacter will gain skills and abilities as he progresses, but these represent enhancements to the basic human personyou are, and enhance, but don&rsquo;t replace your real-life ability to sneak, fight, climb walls and think your way throughfiendish puzzles. It&rsquo;s important to remember that things are happening in real time, and you are constantly in-character.If you do or say something during Time In, then your character has said or done that and there is no way to take it back.So, be careful whom you hit in the dark.</p><h2 id=live-role-playing-at-labyrinthe>Live Role-Playing at Labyrinthe
<a class=anchor href=#live-role-playing-at-labyrinthe>#</a></h2><p>So, you’ve decided to try Live Role-playing at Labyrinthe you’ll find that Labyrinthe is a great system with a wonderfully
rich history and ever-evolving background.</p><p>Labyrinthe is a High Heroic Fantasy System. The adventures take place in a world where magic is common, wherearmies of hideous demons can invade through gateways to other worlds and the fate of an Empire can depend upon theactions of a handful of Heroes. To face the many challenges that the world offers, the player characters are larger thanlife and can achieve super-human things. There are warriors who can stand in the face of an enemy and be wounded hundreds of times yet not fall, wizards who cast dozens of bolts of flame and lightning at their foes, scouts who sneakthrough cities as silently as cats and invisible to mere mortals, and priests who can discover secrets lost for thousands ofyears, or restore the dead to life.</p><p>Labyrinthe is a Heroic System, and as a result there is virtually no limit as to how powerful a character from humblebeginnings may become. Part of Labyrinthe’s unique appeal is just how much development is possible for the shrewdadventurer (see Post 8th Level Development pg 76). Part of this appeal is the long term potential to create charactersthat are unique in their abilities and natures. Today you may be just a farm boy with nothing but dad&rsquo;s rusty sword, butone day you could become a general of the Imperial Army with a blade of pure magic, capable of dodging arrows andleaping buildings with your incredible acrobatic skills. There are also avenues of development that take place inendeavours not directly linked to Adventures.</p><p>It is even rumoured that a handful of the most powerful of the Heroes of The Empire have ascended to god hood and watch over their lesser brethren and rarely take direct action.</p><h3 id=adventures>Adventures
<a class=anchor href=#adventures>#</a></h3><p>Adventure length is defined by section. A standard adventure length is referred to as a Double Length as on a typicalday’s adventuring two sections are run. These can be run as two separate adventures known as Single Lengths.Nowadays, single lengths are rare, and the norm is two connected sections following on one after the other. It is,however, possible to run Single Lengths by special arrangement, and in the summer months longer events at outdoorlocations are also run, but these require special arrangement. It is not necessary to play all the sections of an Adventurebut if you miss sections it will be far less enjoyable.</p><h3 id=first-time-players>First Time Players
<a class=anchor href=#first-time-players>#</a></h3><p>On your first visit it’s essential to let your referee know that you are a new or inexperienced player. First time players arereferred to as Basics. The referee will go over the most important rules with you before you begin and give a brieftutorial on such things as LRP combat. As a Basic player, you’ll find any number of people who are more than willing tohelp you both as a new player and as a new character. As a new character they’ll probably expect some sort of payback, eventually, but hey, in a fantasy world nothing is for free. As a new player they’ll want to ensure that you canget just as much fun out of their hobby as they do. The more the merrier. If you’re not the self-conscious type, trystanding up, waving your hands in the air and asking if anyone can help out a new “X, Y or Z”, insert your choice ofcharacter and more often than not this will elicit a helpful response!</p><h3 id=young-players>Young Players
<a class=anchor href=#young-players>#</a></h3><p>Specially catered adventures are run on Saturdays for younger players (Young Player Dungeons). However, for youngplayers the day starts a little later and ends a little earlier. This in general helps keep them separated from the adultplayers but does mean that only two sections are run a day. During holiday times extra adventures can be run for YoungPlayers on a Thursday, when there is sufficient interest. Young Players range from age 11 to 14 – you cannot play atLabyrinthe until you are 11, and when you reach 15 you are expected to move to normal ‘adult’ adventures.</p><h3 id=club-membership>Club Membership
<a class=anchor href=#club-membership>#</a></h3><p>On your first visit to Labyrinthe you’ll need to fill in a membership form. You will be issued with a Membership Card andMember Number. Your Member Number is important because if there is any internal club mail for you it will be filed byMember Number. Your Membership card is also used for keeping track of any <a href>Monster Points</a> that you earn.</p><h2 id=acceptable-behaviour-at-labyrinthe>Acceptable Behaviour at Labyrinthe
<a class=anchor href=#acceptable-behaviour-at-labyrinthe>#</a></h2><h3 id=courtesy>Courtesy
<a class=anchor href=#courtesy>#</a></h3><p>The Labyrinthe club would ask that all those participating try to keep in mind some simple rules of courtesy, both within
the game, when dealing with other club members and dealing with the club itself.
Respect Other Participants: Especially with regards to safety. We would ask that you follow the safety rules and
instructions given to you at all times and take particular care with weapon blows (see Safety pg 7).
Respect Property: Treat all kit, including your own, with respect. Check for wear and tear regularly as this can affect
how safe it is to use. Ensure club kit is returned at the end of the adventure.
Respect the sites that we use: Do not litter them. Try to park in the appropriate places. If putting on or washing off
make-up at a hand-washing sink please ensure that you clean them afterwards. When using Overland sites bear in mind
that some are places open to the general public and ensure that we are not blocking the use of rights of way by other
people. On those sites where horse riding takes place please ensure that you are quiet and stop when riders come past,
as some horses are easily startled.
Respect the management: Consultation will always be sought with players when appropriate, but once a decision has
been made it is final. Please be tolerant of Real World issues that might cause a delay in the running of Labyrinthe.
Respect the adventure: Book in advance and try to pay in advance, or at least as early as possible. Turn up on time
and get into costume as soon as possible.
Respect the referee and monsters: On an adventure the referee’s decision is final. Any unresolved issues after time
out is called should be brought up with the desk. Remember that without referees no dungeons would be written.
Always try to thank monsters for their efforts, without monsters very, very few dungeons could be run!
Respect Other Dungeons: When moving through other people’s dungeons areas as is sometimes necessary at the
start or finish of a section, do so as quickly and quietly as possible. Obtain the permission of whoever is refereeing the
party in that area if possible so as not to disturb those there.
Remember it is a game where you are meant to have fun, treat people with the same kind of respect that you would wish
to be treated with and treat all kit with care.</p><h3 id=language>Language
<a class=anchor href=#language>#</a></h3><p>At the club we ask that you refrain from bad language. We appreciate that your character may want to express strong
language and ask that if you think about limiting this and always think in terms of non-modern profanities. The use of
modern swearing is unnecessary and will often draw people out of character due to its strongly contemporary
connotations and associations.</p><h3 id=party-killing>Party Killing
<a class=anchor href=#party-killing>#</a></h3><p>It is worth being aware that the Labyrinthe System allows Player Characters to attack and slay other Player
Characters. It is not a common thing but there are no Game rules preventing such an occurrence from happening
although unsurprisingly the In Game government frowns upon actions such as murder (see Recognition of the
Mercenary Caste pg 65). As a new player more experienced club members will try to avoid putting themselves in the
situations where they feel that it might be necessary to kill your character but don’t expect them to hold back if you call
yourself William the Bloody and expect the goodly characters you are with to allow you to just get on with it if you
haplessly butcher the innocent or insult their deity!</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/christiffer/labyrinthe-books/commit/ec9e2d84681e4676ce076241d90131700c9c2ae5 title='Last modified by christiffer | February 13, 2022' target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/labyrinthe-books/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt=Calendar>
