Certain races, notably Trolls, have evolved tough hides or bony plate coverings that innately grant PAC as a natural protection, but PAC is usually dependant on the type of armour that you wear.
Advantages of PAC # As long as you are wearing the armour it will apply to blows made by a weapon with a physical component.</description></item><item><title>Dexterity Armour Class - DAC</title><link>http://christiffer.github.io/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/amour-class/dac/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://christiffer.github.io/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/amour-class/dac/</guid><description>Dexterity Armour Class ~ DAC # DAC represents a characters ability to dodge a blow, to simply not be there when it lands, to roll with it or to twist and turn such that it merely glances off them without injury. Certain races, notably Goblins, are naturally highly dextrous and certain classes, such as Scouts, have agility bonuses.
Advantages of DAC # As long as the character is able to freely move his body then it applies to any weapon blow including supernatural ones such as a purely magical sword or a purely spiritual Mace.</description></item><item><title>Magical Armour Class - MAC</title><link>http://christiffer.github.io/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/amour-class/mac/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://christiffer.github.io/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/amour-class/mac/</guid><description>Magical Armour Class ~ MAC # MAC is generally created through use of Spells. Certain races, notably Elves, have evolved the ability to create MAC as a natural protection
Spell Defence # Each point of MAC protects against 6/1 of a magical blast-type spell’s damage. It stops 6pts of TBLP damage and 1pt to each Location. Against targeted spells like Shock it applies just as PAC does to a weapon blow – each point of MAC stops 1pt of damage.</description></item><item><title>Spiritual Armour Class - SAC</title><link>http://christiffer.github.io/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/amour-class/sac/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://christiffer.github.io/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/amour-class/sac/</guid><description>Spiritual Armour Class ~ SAC # SAC is generally created through use of Miracles. Miracle Defence: Each point of SAC protects against 6/1 of a Miracle’s damage if that miracles harms every location. It stops 6 pts of TBLP damage and 1pt to each Location. For Example
The Evil Miracle Cause Grievous Wounds inflicts 36/5, i. e.miracle hits someone with SAC 1 then they only suffer 30/4 damage. 36 TBLP and 5 to each location.</description></item><item><title>Supernatural Armour</title><link>http://christiffer.github.io/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/amour-class/supernatural-armour/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://christiffer.github.io/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/amour-class/supernatural-armour/</guid><description>Supernatural Armour # It is possible for normal physical armour to be empowered with supernatural energy, either Magical or Spiritual. In this case it might be referred to as +0 Magic Armour or +0 Spirit Armour. A suit of armour so empowered offers some supernatural protection. Additionally it cannot be destroyed by normal magical or spiritual means that would destroy a mundane object. +0 Magical Armour allows the AC value to be applied versus purely magical weapon blows.</description></item></channel></rss>
