<a class=anchor href=#combat>#</a></h1><p>As previously mentioned Labyrinthe is an Heroic System. As a result the basic combat system is not a simple 1 hit affair.
One of the advantages of a Heroic System is that you don’t actually have to have the martial prowess of an Olympic
fencer to be able to enjoy yourself. The chances of your character surviving a combat are enhanced by your choice of
Class, Race and the armour that you wear. Those who don’t feel their skills quite match up can choose a naturally
combat hardy character, those who want a challenge might play a less combat hardy character and rely more on natural
skill. We cater for all. Obviously the better you are the better your character’s chance of survival is but as in all things a
little time and practice will make all the difference.</p><h2 id=safety>Safety
<a class=anchor href=#safety>#</a></h2><p>Firstly and paramount to discussion of combat is safety. We’re all here to have fun and getting hurt tends to detract from
such a goal. The equipment used is designed with this in mind - however even the safest equipment can cause a degree
of pain or injury if not used correctly and responsibly. On your first visit your referee should instruct you in the safe usage
of weapons. If for any reason they don’t please ask them to do so. Its quite simple and bearing a few basic principles in
mind can prevent serious accident. The basic principle of LRP combat is to mimic a ‘real’ combat while striking only
blows that are safe, by pulling them and using padded LRP weapons.
For safety reasons the following are not permitted:
Grabbing or grappling of other players is not permitted.
Using Thrusting attacks with weapons is not permitted.
LRP weapons are designed to slash, not thrust, and are built around cores that flex sideways when used for slashing
strikes. However, if they are used to thrust, they will not flex properly and can seriously hurt an opponent. Likewise,
players who use long weapons like spears should be careful when pointing weapons at monsters that are advancing
towards the players in case of catching them on the end of a set spear, as this can injure people.
No blow to the head, no matter how carefully aimed is pleasant. While blows should not be aimed at the head
deliberately, sometimes it is the only target available, for example fighting an opponent with a shield, or over a wall. In
these situations, care should be taken to ensure any blow struck is sufficiently pulled to be safe.
If a monster or player is obviously blocking an exit it is considered discourteous (and not within the spirit of these rules) to
use the fact that they cannot physically grapple to keep you in place to just push or barge past them.
It is worth remembering that this is a physical game. A degree of physical contact and running around in a darkened
cave system can result in the odd cut, scrape or bruise, just as with any other sport.
Game-system Strength should not be used to restrain or push anyone around, Grappling is not part of the game system!
Strength may be used to carry dead, inert or helpless bodies, or willing people.</p><h2 id=monstering>Monstering
<a class=anchor href=#monstering>#</a></h2><p>What’s the most important thing that every great Hero needs? Well, a great villain. In a similar vein for adventures to be
run we need people to play the baddies, the adversaries. These are the monsters. Monsters are essential to any well-
run dungeon. Their effort can make or break the players’ day. Monsters and monster quality are an essential part of
LRP. Well-played monsters can change a mediocre adventure into an epic. Bad monstering will ruin any adventure.
The name of the game, as in all aspects of live role-playing, is roleplay. Even low hit &ldquo;Cannon fodder&rdquo; creatures have
personalities and this should be reflected in their portrayal. A monster should act like a character in that it may place
considerable importance on self-preservation. Mindless suicidal assaults are not always appropriate. Needless to say a
monster should stick to its brief. A two hit goblin must fall over after its two hits, with decent role-play of his last
convulsions. A second level monster Wizard should not quietly decide to promote himself to a fourth.
It is important that an adventure is not viewed by the monster as a grudge fight between themselves and the players.
The object after all is for both parties to have a good time, and it is not a competition. In recognition of the importance of
a monster’s services there are various bonuses that can be gained from Monstering:
The first of these bonuses takes the form of credits. Details of these are found in Appendix I: Credits pg 81. The
second of these bonuses takes the form of monster points. Details on these are found in Error! Reference source not
found. pg Error! Bookmark not defined..
Finally, monstering is an excellent way of practising the various skills needed for playing your own character without the
possible trauma of that character&rsquo;s death. Many players develop confidence and experience of the Labyrinthe system by
regular monstering.</p><h2 id=damage-grades>Damage Grades
<a class=anchor href=#damage-grades>#</a></h2><p>The damage inflicted against Player Characters and against Monsters is dealt with differently. At the lower level of the
system monsters are generally only given a number of Hits. Nothing more fancy than that. A six hit monster will take six
hits before dying. Damage comes in grades which are multiples of the basic damage call, so Double, Triple, Quad, or
even Quin or more (at high levels!). Monsters typically only have a few minutes to absorb their stats and roleplay, while
player characters develop theirs over a course of hours, days or even months, so the system for monster hit calculation
needs to stay simple in comparison,
For example our six hit monster from above can take either 6 singles before expiring, 3 Doubles before expiring or 2
Triples. Different abilities exist to enhance the amount of damage a player may inflict and these are dealt with later:
Against PCs each grade inflicts 6pts of damage
For Example:
A “Single” Grade delivers 6pts of damage
A “Double” Grade delivers 12pts of damage
A “Triple” Grade delivers 18pts of damage
A “Quad” Grade delivers 24pts of damage
Bastard Grades deliver 3pts less damage than a full grade.
For Example:
A “Bastard Double” delivers 9pts of damage
A “Bastard Triple” delivers 15pts of damage
8
Under no circumstances can characters call Quin (or higher grades of damage) without an ability that specifically lets
them exceed Quad – Quad is the normal system maximum.</p><h2 id=life-death--the-bits-in-between>Life, Death & The Bits In Between!
<a class=anchor href=#life-death--the-bits-in-between>#</a></h2><p>A monster dies when its Hits are reduced to zero. They may also fall unconscious or have their limbs break if the referee
has set them with locational hits (for example, 6 hits and 2 each location – so one Double to the arm breaks it, but it
takes 3 Doubles to kill the monster). For a Player Character it is a little more complicated:
Player characters have a certain amount of life points, both Total Body Life Points (TBLP) and Locational (Loc) life
points to the different parts of their body. This might be represented as 30/10 (30 TBLP, 10 to each location).
If a location is reduced to zero then it stops working.
If a location is reduced below zero then it starts to bleed and the character suffers further damage until either: they die,
the bleeding is staunched or they are healed.
Should a Critical Location, (Head, Chest or Abdomen), be reduced to zero then the PC is rendered unconscious.
If a location suffers damage equal to twice its starting maximum then it is severed.
If a Critical location is severed, i.e. suffers damage equal to twice its maximum, then the Character dies.
If a PC’s TBLP drops to zero they are rendered unconscious
If a PC’s TBLP drops below zero then they die.
When a location is not working you cannot use it and should do your best to just let it hang limply. If you are
unconscious or dead you cannot do anything and so should just lie there. Talking when unconscious or dead is
cheating!
After a dungeon if your character is dead they still cannot do anything, so no asking your mate to try to rescue your dead
body! A dead character can be considered to be someone else’s property, if someone has the corpse. They are
completely at the mercy of whoever has their remains. Usually the player who has the dead character will be given the
dead character’s Character Card as proof that they have the corpse. What they do with it is entirely up to them! In some
cases powerful player characters may be able to restore the dead to life, but this is not something to rely on. For more
details on death see Dead Bodies and Death pg 86.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/christiffer/labyrinthe-books/commit/ec9e2d84681e4676ce076241d90131700c9c2ae5 title='Last modified by christiffer | February 13, 2022' target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/labyrinthe-books/svg/calendar.svg class=book-icon alt=Calendar>
