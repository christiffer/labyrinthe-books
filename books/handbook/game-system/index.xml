They may be not currently playing a part, or being a part, which is invisible, or hidden, or supernaturally travelling (referred to as shifting) from one location to another. It generally means that you cannot interact with them and you should ignore their presence and not react to them in any fashion – roleplay as if you are not aware of them.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://christiffer.github.io/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/combat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://christiffer.github.io/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/combat/</guid><description>Combat # As previously mentioned Labyrinthe is an Heroic System. As a result the basic combat system is not a simple 1 hit affair. One of the advantages of a Heroic System is that you don’t actually have to have the martial prowess of an Olympic fencer to be able to enjoy yourself. The chances of your character surviving a combat are enhanced by your choice of Class, Race and the armour that you wear.</description></item></channel></rss>
