[{"id":0,"href":"/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/","title":"Handbook","section":"Rule Books","content":"3rd Edition Basic Handbook #  Introduction #  This book is divided up into two parts:\nThe first section deals with everything that you need to know to start to play in the Labyrinthe Live Role-playing environment and are all the basic rules that you are likely to need as you progress from a 1st Level novice up to an 8th Level seasoned mercenary. It tends to deal with the kind of thing that you are most likely to meet on your first few Adventures. The Classes and Races listed are those that we recommend that you familiarise yourself with and playbefore trying the more complex Classes. If once you have read through this and have quite a firm idea of what basicclass you want to play we would thoroughly suggest that you get hold of the relevant publication with the more in depthdetails relating to that class.\nThe second section is a reference for more experienced players who require information that may not be contained inother publications and also to give you a basic idea as to the beginnings of further character development andprogression.\nLive Role-Playing #  Live Role-playing is exactly what its name suggests - live. If you want to spot the monster hidden in the corner or sneakthrough a room in the dark you are going to have to keep your eyes open and watch where you are stepping. Yourcharacter will gain skills and abilities as he progresses, but these represent enhancements to the basic human personyou are, and enhance, but don\u0026rsquo;t replace your real-life ability to sneak, fight, climb walls and think your way throughfiendish puzzles. It\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that things are happening in real time, and you are constantly in-character.If you do or say something during Time In, then your character has said or done that and there is no way to take it back.So, be careful whom you hit in the dark.\nLive Role-Playing at Labyrinthe #  So, you’ve decided to try Live Role-playing at Labyrinthe you’ll find that Labyrinthe is a great system with a wonderfully rich history and ever-evolving background.\nLabyrinthe is a High Heroic Fantasy System. The adventures take place in a world where magic is common, wherearmies of hideous demons can invade through gateways to other worlds and the fate of an Empire can depend upon theactions of a handful of Heroes. To face the many challenges that the world offers, the player characters are larger thanlife and can achieve super-human things. There are warriors who can stand in the face of an enemy and be wounded hundreds of times yet not fall, wizards who cast dozens of bolts of flame and lightning at their foes, scouts who sneakthrough cities as silently as cats and invisible to mere mortals, and priests who can discover secrets lost for thousands ofyears, or restore the dead to life.\nLabyrinthe is a Heroic System, and as a result there is virtually no limit as to how powerful a character from humblebeginnings may become. Part of Labyrinthe’s unique appeal is just how much development is possible for the shrewdadventurer (see Post 8th Level Development pg 76). Part of this appeal is the long term potential to create charactersthat are unique in their abilities and natures. Today you may be just a farm boy with nothing but dad\u0026rsquo;s rusty sword, butone day you could become a general of the Imperial Army with a blade of pure magic, capable of dodging arrows andleaping buildings with your incredible acrobatic skills. There are also avenues of development that take place inendeavours not directly linked to Adventures.\nIt is even rumoured that a handful of the most powerful of the Heroes of The Empire have ascended to god hood and watch over their lesser brethren and rarely take direct action.\nAdventures #  Adventure length is defined by section. A standard adventure length is referred to as a Double Length as on a typicalday’s adventuring two sections are run. These can be run as two separate adventures known as Single Lengths.Nowadays, single lengths are rare, and the norm is two connected sections following on one after the other. It is,however, possible to run Single Lengths by special arrangement, and in the summer months longer events at outdoorlocations are also run, but these require special arrangement. It is not necessary to play all the sections of an Adventurebut if you miss sections it will be far less enjoyable.\nFirst Time Players #  On your first visit it’s essential to let your referee know that you are a new or inexperienced player. First time players arereferred to as Basics. The referee will go over the most important rules with you before you begin and give a brieftutorial on such things as LRP combat. As a Basic player, you’ll find any number of people who are more than willing tohelp you both as a new player and as a new character. As a new character they’ll probably expect some sort of payback, eventually, but hey, in a fantasy world nothing is for free. As a new player they’ll want to ensure that you canget just as much fun out of their hobby as they do. The more the merrier. If you’re not the self-conscious type, trystanding up, waving your hands in the air and asking if anyone can help out a new “X, Y or Z”, insert your choice ofcharacter and more often than not this will elicit a helpful response!\nYoung Players #  Specially catered adventures are run on Saturdays for younger players (Young Player Dungeons). However, for youngplayers the day starts a little later and ends a little earlier. This in general helps keep them separated from the adultplayers but does mean that only two sections are run a day. During holiday times extra adventures can be run for YoungPlayers on a Thursday, when there is sufficient interest. Young Players range from age 11 to 14 – you cannot play atLabyrinthe until you are 11, and when you reach 15 you are expected to move to normal ‘adult’ adventures.\nClub Membership #  On your first visit to Labyrinthe you’ll need to fill in a membership form. You will be issued with a Membership Card andMember Number. Your Member Number is important because if there is any internal club mail for you it will be filed byMember Number. Your Membership card is also used for keeping track of any Monster Points that you earn.\nAcceptable Behaviour at Labyrinthe #  Courtesy #  The Labyrinthe club would ask that all those participating try to keep in mind some simple rules of courtesy, both within the game, when dealing with other club members and dealing with the club itself. Respect Other Participants: Especially with regards to safety. We would ask that you follow the safety rules and instructions given to you at all times and take particular care with weapon blows (see Safety pg 7). Respect Property: Treat all kit, including your own, with respect. Check for wear and tear regularly as this can affect how safe it is to use. Ensure club kit is returned at the end of the adventure. Respect the sites that we use: Do not litter them. Try to park in the appropriate places. If putting on or washing off make-up at a hand-washing sink please ensure that you clean them afterwards. When using Overland sites bear in mind that some are places open to the general public and ensure that we are not blocking the use of rights of way by other people. On those sites where horse riding takes place please ensure that you are quiet and stop when riders come past, as some horses are easily startled. Respect the management: Consultation will always be sought with players when appropriate, but once a decision has been made it is final. Please be tolerant of Real World issues that might cause a delay in the running of Labyrinthe. Respect the adventure: Book in advance and try to pay in advance, or at least as early as possible. Turn up on time and get into costume as soon as possible. Respect the referee and monsters: On an adventure the referee’s decision is final. Any unresolved issues after time out is called should be brought up with the desk. Remember that without referees no dungeons would be written. Always try to thank monsters for their efforts, without monsters very, very few dungeons could be run! Respect Other Dungeons: When moving through other people’s dungeons areas as is sometimes necessary at the start or finish of a section, do so as quickly and quietly as possible. Obtain the permission of whoever is refereeing the party in that area if possible so as not to disturb those there. Remember it is a game where you are meant to have fun, treat people with the same kind of respect that you would wish to be treated with and treat all kit with care.\nLanguage #  At the club we ask that you refrain from bad language. We appreciate that your character may want to express strong language and ask that if you think about limiting this and always think in terms of non-modern profanities. The use of modern swearing is unnecessary and will often draw people out of character due to its strongly contemporary connotations and associations.\nParty Killing #  It is worth being aware that the Labyrinthe System allows Player Characters to attack and slay other Player Characters. It is not a common thing but there are no Game rules preventing such an occurrence from happening although unsurprisingly the In Game government frowns upon actions such as murder (see Recognition of the Mercenary Caste pg 65). As a new player more experienced club members will try to avoid putting themselves in the situations where they feel that it might be necessary to kill your character but don’t expect them to hold back if you call yourself William the Bloody and expect the goodly characters you are with to allow you to just get on with it if you haplessly butcher the innocent or insult their deity!\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/game-mechanics/","title":"Game Mechanics","section":"Game System","content":"Game Mechanics #  Hand In The Air #  A monster, or even a player, with his hand in the air is deemed not to be present in some fashion. They may be not currently playing a part, or being a part, which is invisible, or hidden, or supernaturally travelling (referred to as shifting) from one location to another. It generally means that you cannot interact with them and you should ignore their presence and not react to them in any fashion – roleplay as if you are not aware of them.\nTime In #  Play starts and the game is live. You become your character. Monsters can attack you. You are expected to speak, behave, react and think as your character. The better you do this the more fun you’re going to have and the more fun the people around you are going to have.\nTime Out #  This is when game play stops. You can relax and be your self again. Usually this signifies the end of a section of Dungeon, or the referee is going to call a break to Battleboard. You can usually sit down and relax.\nTime Stop #  The game is ‘paused’ immediately when Time Stop is called. When the ref wants to give a specific description he will call a Time Stop. During a Time Stop you stay where you are, keep quiet and listen to what is said. Some abilities possessed by a character may allow them to call a time stop and take action.\nTime Freeze #  The game is ‘paused’ immediately when Time Freeze is called, but you are also required to close your eyes and wait. Something instantaneous has happened, perhaps an explosion or a creature appearing. The referee might want to be able to check who is affected or to explain what has happened or to re-arrange your surroundings et cetera. Sometimes your referee may even ask you to hum to mask the sounds of what he or the monsters are doing.\nBattleboarding #  Battleboarding is when the referee makes a list of what powers you have used and what damage or effects you may have suffered at the hands of the opposition. On the average dungeon this is usually done in a Time Out situation. You need to relate everything that affects your stats that you did or that happened to you and this must be listed in the same order that it happened. This can be very important, especially if you forget to mention that halfway through the fight the Priest healed you! Correct battleboarding is very important to game play and a certain amount of trust that the player will correctly battleboard is required. Referees do tend to keep an eye on players during combats to see if they own up to the blows they took in a combat\u0026hellip;.\nTime Faff #  Time Faff was invented by referees of their own accord some years back, and is now a generally accepted convention on adventures. During Time Faff the game is still continuing, but players are expected to find reasons to remain where they are and not to initiate any combats – they can continue to talk and roleplay, or similar. The purpose of Time Faff is to allow the referee or monsters to prepare further encounters ahead without having to ask the party to stop roleplaying and suspend the game.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/equiptment/money/","title":"Money","section":"Costume, Weapons \u0026 Equiptment","content":"Money ~ Grulls #  The in-character currency of The Empire is the grull, which comes in denominational notes from 10G to 5000G in value.\nA day\u0026rsquo;s adventuring will earn you between a couple of hundred and a few thousand grulls, depending on your level. This could be in the form of pay from the merchant who hires you to rescue his daughter, or treasure looted from an ogre\u0026rsquo;s horde. Grulls can be spent on:\n Armour Spell Glyphs Making potions Making Magical or Spiritual scrolls Making Supernatural Items such as magic swords and talismans of supernatural power Buying scrolls Buying healing potions Bribing monsters, paying other players to watch your back, paying the troll to let you cross his bridge and any other things you can come up with on your adventure.  Any physical object that you buy with grulls such as armour or potions still requires you to provide an actual physical representation (abbreviated to as a Phys-rep) as what you will get when you hand over your money is an official card stating precisely what it is that your character owns. These cards can be traded with other characters, in fact some things, notably potions or scrolls, are almost only available by such trade.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/amour-class/pac/","title":"Physical Armour Class - PAC","section":"Armour Class","content":"Physical Armour Class ~ PAC #  PAC is armour that protects from physical attacks. Certain races, notably Trolls, have evolved tough hides or bony plate coverings that innately grant PAC as a natural protection, but PAC is usually dependant on the type of armour that you wear.\nAdvantages of PAC #  As long as you are wearing the armour it will apply to blows made by a weapon with a physical component. You don’t even need to be conscious to benefit from it.\nDisadvantages of PAC #  It offers no protection against Spells or Miracles or supernatural weapons that do not have a physical component, such as a purely magical sword or a purely spiritual Mace. It only applies to the location where armour is actually physically worn. However a concession is made in that any armour up to AC 3, unless it is master crafted armour, does not require a Phys Rep.\nPhysical Armour Types #  The benefits gained from different types of armour are as follows:\n   PAC Description     1 Soft Leather   1 Heavy Leather Clothing   1 Furs / Fur Clothing   1 Padded Cloth - 1/2 Inch Thick eg. padded jacks   2 Rigid Leather (Typically hard leather vambraces or greaves)   3 Studded Leather (Soft leather with a substantial number of rivets, studs and / or hard leather reinforcement covering)   4 Reinforced leather. (Hard leather with a substantial number of rivets, studs and / or hard leather reinforcement)   4 Light mail. (Mail made from wire, or Big-ring-little-ring mail made from spring washers)   5 Heavy mail (Each ring into four others mail made from spring washers)   5 Brigantine (Metal plates riveted or sewn to leather)   5 Ring (Metal rings sewn or thonged to leather)   5 Scale (Close fitting regularly shaped metal plates attached to each other)   6 Plate (Solid one piece metal covering 3⁄4 of the location or more)    A new ordinary suit of armour wears out and becomes totally irreparable after 5 adventures regardless of the length of the adventures. Armour cannot have uses restored by Mend, Reform or Reshape spells et cetera. For details on the cost of armour see Armour.\nIt is also possible to acquire bonus or temporary AC from items, potions, spells and guilds. What types of armour class, and whether it stacks with the characters own armour is specified in the ability.\nMastercrafted Armour #  Master crafted armour requires a totally genuine, and often expensive in real terms, Physical Representation (Phys Rep), however it does have an armour class of + 2 AC greater than the equivalent ordinary armour. Its cost in grulls is equal to the armour class provided. To claim master crafted armour value (+2 PAC), you must have a suitable phys-rep for the armour. If you do not have the correct phys-rep you may not claim the +2 PAC armour value and gain only the base AC. The phys-rep should cover at least three quarters of the location. Interpretation of the armour categories above will be the harshest – if your armour is not clearly appropriate to a category, you will be awarded a lower AC value. A few rings sewn onto a leather tunic do not make it ringmail, realism in appearance is the key here!\nMaster crafted armour has 10 such uses before wearing out but it should be noted that if a master crafted phys rep is not worn the armour suffers two uses per adventure and the +2 PAC bonus for master crafted may not be claimed.\nFor Example #   Rudolf the Blue Wizard is wearing AC 2 all over (leather armour without a phys-rep. If he casts a Plate Spell, for 5 minutes he is in AC 5 all over, as they do not stack.\n  Eric the Warrior is wearing mastercrafted chain mail on his chest and abdomen for AC 6, and AC 3 elsewhere. He has a \u0026ldquo;Bless\u0026rdquo; miracle cast on him, which gives him 2 DAC, and has an Artefact that gives him another 2 DAC. Since he only has Max AC 9, he battle boards AC 9 to chest and abdomen, AC 7 elsewhere.\n Layering armour #  Armour may seem to grant insufficient protection when one considers the amount of beating and bashing taken by an average knight in a battle, or the number of blows landed on a competitor in the melee of a tournament. This is because they wore good, well-fitted armour that was worn in layers and covered the entire location. To this end, if you wear mastercrafted leather armour under armour of at least AC 4+2 value (light mail+), you gain an additional point of PAC. If you wear mastercrafted armour of AC 4+2 value, such as light mail, under armour of still higher value, you get an additional two points of PAC. Thus a warrior wearing a rigid one-piece steel Breastplate over a set of light chainmail would gain AC equal to 6+2+2 for 10 points of physical armour class!\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/labyrinthe-books/books/","title":"Rule Books","section":"","content":"Post 8th Development Tables #  "},{"id":5,"href":"/labyrinthe-books/books/grimoire/spells/standard/","title":"Standard Spells","section":"Spells","content":"   Detect Magic     Level 0 Colour Grey Duration    Verbal I call upon the elements of fire, air, earth and water, reveal to me where you may be found...

As a result the basic combat system is not a simple 1 hit affair. One of the advantages of a Heroic System is that you don’t actually have to have the martial prowess of an Olympic fencer to be able to enjoy yourself. The chances of your character surviving a combat are enhanced by your choice of Class, Race and the armour that you wear. Those who don’t feel their skills quite match up can choose a naturally combat hardy character, those who want a challenge might play a less combat hardy character and rely more on natural skill. We cater for all. Obviously the better you are the better your character’s chance of survival is but as in all things a little time and practice will make all the difference.\nSafety #  Firstly and paramount to discussion of combat is safety. We’re all here to have fun and getting hurt tends to detract from such a goal. The equipment used is designed with this in mind - however even the safest equipment can cause a degree of pain or injury if not used correctly and responsibly. On your first visit your referee should instruct you in the safe usage of weapons. If for any reason they don’t please ask them to do so. Its quite simple and bearing a few basic principles in mind can prevent serious accident. The basic principle of LRP combat is to mimic a ‘real’ combat while striking only blows that are safe, by pulling them and using padded LRP weapons. For safety reasons the following are not permitted: Grabbing or grappling of other players is not permitted. Using Thrusting attacks with weapons is not permitted. LRP weapons are designed to slash, not thrust, and are built around cores that flex sideways when used for slashing strikes. However, if they are used to thrust, they will not flex properly and can seriously hurt an opponent. Likewise, players who use long weapons like spears should be careful when pointing weapons at monsters that are advancing towards the players in case of catching them on the end of a set spear, as this can injure people. No blow to the head, no matter how carefully aimed is pleasant. While blows should not be aimed at the head deliberately, sometimes it is the only target available, for example fighting an opponent with a shield, or over a wall. In these situations, care should be taken to ensure any blow struck is sufficiently pulled to be safe. If a monster or player is obviously blocking an exit it is considered discourteous (and not within the spirit of these rules) to use the fact that they cannot physically grapple to keep you in place to just push or barge past them. It is worth remembering that this is a physical game. A degree of physical contact and running around in a darkened cave system can result in the odd cut, scrape or bruise, just as with any other sport. Game-system Strength should not be used to restrain or push anyone around, Grappling is not part of the game system! Strength may be used to carry dead, inert or helpless bodies, or willing people.\nMonstering #  What’s the most important thing that every great Hero needs? Well, a great villain. In a similar vein for adventures to be run we need people to play the baddies, the adversaries. These are the monsters. Monsters are essential to any well- run dungeon. Their effort can make or break the players’ day. Monsters and monster quality are an essential part of LRP. Well-played monsters can change a mediocre adventure into an epic. Bad monstering will ruin any adventure. The name of the game, as in all aspects of live role-playing, is roleplay. Even low hit \u0026ldquo;Cannon fodder\u0026rdquo; creatures have personalities and this should be reflected in their portrayal. A monster should act like a character in that it may place considerable importance on self-preservation. Mindless suicidal assaults are not always appropriate. Needless to say a monster should stick to its brief. A two hit goblin must fall over after its two hits, with decent role-play of his last convulsions. A second level monster Wizard should not quietly decide to promote himself to a fourth. It is important that an adventure is not viewed by the monster as a grudge fight between themselves and the players. The object after all is for both parties to have a good time, and it is not a competition. In recognition of the importance of a monster’s services there are various bonuses that can be gained from Monstering: The first of these bonuses takes the form of credits. Details of these are found in Appendix I: Credits pg 81. The second of these bonuses takes the form of monster points. Details on these are found in Error! Reference source not found. pg Error! Bookmark not defined.. Finally, monstering is an excellent way of practising the various skills needed for playing your own character without the possible trauma of that character\u0026rsquo;s death. Many players develop confidence and experience of the Labyrinthe system by regular monstering.\nDamage Grades #  The damage inflicted against Player Characters and against Monsters is dealt with differently. At the lower level of the system monsters are generally only given a number of Hits. Nothing more fancy than that. A six hit monster will take six hits before dying. Damage comes in grades which are multiples of the basic damage call, so Double, Triple, Quad, or even Quin or more (at high levels!). Monsters typically only have a few minutes to absorb their stats and roleplay, while player characters develop theirs over a course of hours, days or even months, so the system for monster hit calculation needs to stay simple in comparison, For example our six hit monster from above can take either 6 singles before expiring, 3 Doubles before expiring or 2 Triples. Different abilities exist to enhance the amount of damage a player may inflict and these are dealt with later: Against PCs each grade inflicts 6pts of damage For Example: A “Single” Grade delivers 6pts of damage A “Double” Grade delivers 12pts of damage A “Triple” Grade delivers 18pts of damage A “Quad” Grade delivers 24pts of damage Bastard Grades deliver 3pts less damage than a full grade. For Example: A “Bastard Double” delivers 9pts of damage A “Bastard Triple” delivers 15pts of damage 8 Under no circumstances can characters call Quin (or higher grades of damage) without an ability that specifically lets them exceed Quad – Quad is the normal system maximum.\nLife, Death \u0026amp; The Bits In Between! #  A monster dies when its Hits are reduced to zero. They may also fall unconscious or have their limbs break if the referee has set them with locational hits (for example, 6 hits and 2 each location – so one Double to the arm breaks it, but it takes 3 Doubles to kill the monster). For a Player Character it is a little more complicated: Player characters have a certain amount of life points, both Total Body Life Points (TBLP) and Locational (Loc) life points to the different parts of their body. This might be represented as 30/10 (30 TBLP, 10 to each location). If a location is reduced to zero then it stops working. If a location is reduced below zero then it starts to bleed and the character suffers further damage until either: they die, the bleeding is staunched or they are healed. Should a Critical Location, (Head, Chest or Abdomen), be reduced to zero then the PC is rendered unconscious. If a location suffers damage equal to twice its starting maximum then it is severed. If a Critical location is severed, i.e. suffers damage equal to twice its maximum, then the Character dies. If a PC’s TBLP drops to zero they are rendered unconscious If a PC’s TBLP drops below zero then they die. When a location is not working you cannot use it and should do your best to just let it hang limply. If you are unconscious or dead you cannot do anything and so should just lie there. Talking when unconscious or dead is cheating! After a dungeon if your character is dead they still cannot do anything, so no asking your mate to try to rescue your dead body! A dead character can be considered to be someone else’s property, if someone has the corpse. They are completely at the mercy of whoever has their remains. Usually the player who has the dead character will be given the dead character’s Character Card as proof that they have the corpse. What they do with it is entirely up to them! In some cases powerful player characters may be able to restore the dead to life, but this is not something to rely on. For more details on death see Dead Bodies and Death pg 86.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/labyrinthe-books/books/handbook/game-system/equiptment/armour/","title":"Armour","section":"Costume, Weapons \u0026 Equiptment","content":"Armour #  Armour Below are listed the cost of purchasing armour in grulls.

Your basic armour class, referred to as AC, is a defence that primarily protects you from weapon blows and comes from two sources, physical armour and dexterity. The type or armour that you may use and how well you can use it depends on your Character Class - for example warriors can wear all sorts of armour but wizards cannot wear armour containing metal. The efficiency with which you can use your armour is known as your Maximum Armour Class usually abbreviated to Max AC and there is an absolute system limit of AC 12, however powerful you get. Starting characters have a much lower value. Additionally no matter how good your armour is weapon blows will always do a minimum of 1pt of damage. This is referred to as Bruising damage. AC reduces the damage you take per weapon blow by an amount equal to the AC value.\n For Example: A Warrior in AC3 struck by a 6pt single would only take 3pts of damage per blow (6 minus 3). If he were struck by a 12pt double he would take 9pts of damage from the blow (12 minus 3) and so on.
