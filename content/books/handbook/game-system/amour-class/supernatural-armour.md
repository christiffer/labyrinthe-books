## Supernatural Armour
It is possible for normal physical armour to be empowered with supernatural energy, either Magical or Spiritual. In this
case it might be referred to as +0 Magic Armour or +0 Spirit Armour. A suit of armour so empowered offers some
supernatural protection. Additionally it cannot be destroyed by normal magical or spiritual means that would destroy a
mundane object.
**+0 Magical Armour** allows the AC value to be applied versus purely magical weapon blows.
**For Example**
> A Warrior in +0 Magical Studded Leather, which would normally confer PAC 3, may apply his armour to the damage from a pure magic weapon. So whereas normal PAC 3 would mean he still takes 6pts of damage from a pure magical sword PAC from the magical armour would mean he now only suffers 3pts of damage.

**+0 Spiritual Armour** functions exactly as +0 Magical but applies versus purely spiritual weapon blows.
In neither case does the armour grant any MAC or SAC, unless the card or ability specifically says it does.
