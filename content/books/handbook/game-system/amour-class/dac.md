# Dexterity Armour Class ~ DAC
DAC represents a characters ability to dodge a blow, to simply not be there when it lands, to roll with it or to twist and
turn such that it merely glances off them without injury. Certain races, notably Goblins, are naturally highly dextrous and
certain classes, such as Scouts, have agility bonuses.
## Advantages of DAC
As long as the character is able to freely move his body then it applies to any weapon blow
including supernatural ones such as a purely magical sword or a purely spiritual Mace. Against physical blows in normal
situations there is no difference in game terms between DAC and PAC. You do NOT need to be aware of the blow, you
are deemed to roll with even an unexpected knife to the back to at least some extent, and gain the bonus AC. Spells
such as Bind are not deemed to restrict your movement sufficiently to prevent DAC from working – other effects may do
at the referee’s discretion.
## Disadvantages of DAC
You need to be free to move and conscious to benefit from it. If you are unable to move freely
then you cannot dodge the blow and cannot benefit from DAC. It offers no protection against Spells, Miracles and Touch
effects.
