# Physical Armour Class ~ PAC
PAC is armour that protects from physical attacks. Certain races, notably Trolls, have evolved tough hides or bony plate
coverings that innately grant PAC as a natural protection, but PAC is usually dependant on the type of armour that you
wear.
## Advantages of PAC
As long as you are wearing the armour it will apply to blows made by a weapon with a physical
component. You don’t even need to be conscious to benefit from it.
## Disadvantages of PAC
It offers no protection against Spells or Miracles or supernatural weapons that do not have a
physical component, such as a purely magical sword or a purely spiritual Mace. It only applies to the location where
armour is actually physically worn. However a concession is made in that any armour up to AC 3, unless it is master
crafted armour, does not require a Phys Rep.

## Physical Armour Types
The benefits gained from different types of armour are as follows:

| PAC | Description |
|---|---|
|  1 | Soft Leather|
|  1 | Heavy Leather Clothing|
|  1 | Furs / Fur Clothing|
|  1 | Padded Cloth - 1/2 Inch Thick eg. padded jacks|
|  2 | Rigid Leather (Typically hard leather vambraces or greaves)|
|  3 | Studded Leather (Soft leather with a substantial number of rivets, studs and / or hard leather reinforcement covering)|
|  4 | Reinforced leather. (Hard leather with a substantial number of rivets, studs and / or hard leather reinforcement) |
|  4 | Light mail. (Mail made from wire, or Big-ring-little-ring mail made from spring washers) |
|  5 | Heavy mail (Each ring into four others mail made from spring washers)|
|  5 | Brigantine (Metal plates riveted or sewn to leather)|
|  5 | Ring (Metal rings sewn or thonged to leather)|
|  5 | Scale (Close fitting regularly shaped metal plates attached to each other)|
|  6 | Plate (Solid one piece metal covering 3⁄4 of the location or more)|

A new ordinary suit of armour wears out and becomes totally irreparable after 5 adventures regardless of the length of
the adventures. Armour cannot have uses restored by Mend, Reform or Reshape spells et cetera. For details on the cost of
armour see [Armour]().

It is also possible to acquire bonus or temporary AC from items, potions, spells and guilds. What types of armour class,
and whether it stacks with the characters own armour is specified in the ability.

### Mastercrafted Armour
Master crafted armour requires a totally genuine, and often expensive in real terms, **Physical Representation** (Phys
Rep), however it does have an armour class of + 2 AC greater than the equivalent ordinary armour. Its cost in grulls is
equal to the armour class provided. To claim master crafted armour value (+2 PAC), you must have a suitable phys-rep
for the armour. If you do not have the correct phys-rep you may not claim the +2 PAC armour value and gain only the
base AC. The phys-rep should cover at least three quarters of the location. Interpretation of the armour categories
above will be the harshest – if your armour is not *clearly* appropriate to a category, you will be awarded a lower AC
value. A few rings sewn onto a leather tunic do not make it ringmail, realism in appearance is the key here!

Master crafted armour has 10 such uses before wearing out but it should be noted that if a master crafted
phys rep is not worn the armour suffers two uses per adventure and the +2 PAC bonus for master crafted may not be
claimed. 

#### For Example
> Rudolf the Blue Wizard is wearing AC 2 all over (leather armour without a phys-rep. If he casts a Plate Spell, for 5 minutes he is in AC 5 all over, as they do not stack.

> Eric the Warrior is wearing mastercrafted chain mail on his chest and abdomen for AC 6, and AC 3 elsewhere. He has a "Bless" miracle cast on him, which gives him 2 DAC, and has an Artefact that gives him another 2 DAC. Since he only has Max AC 9, he battle boards AC 9 to chest and abdomen, AC 7 elsewhere.

## Layering armour
Armour may seem to grant insufficient protection when one considers the amount of beating and bashing taken by an
average knight in a battle, or the number of blows landed on a competitor in the melee of a tournament. This is because
they wore good, well-fitted armour that was worn in layers and covered the entire location.
To this end, if you wear mastercrafted leather armour **under** armour of at least AC 4+2 value (light mail+), you gain an
additional point of PAC. If you wear mastercrafted armour of AC 4+2 value, such as light mail, under armour of still
higher value, you get an additional two points of PAC. Thus a warrior wearing a rigid one-piece steel Breastplate over a
set of light chainmail would gain AC equal to 6+2+2 for 10 points of physical armour class!
