## Magical Armour Class ~ MAC
MAC is generally created through use of Spells. Certain races, notably Elves, have evolved the ability to create MAC as
a natural protection
### Spell Defence
Each point of MAC protects against 6/1 of a magical blast-type spell’s damage. It stops 6pts of TBLP
damage and 1pt to each Location. Against targeted spells like Shock it applies just as PAC does to a weapon blow –
each point of MAC stops 1pt of damage.
**For Example**
> The Blue Wizard spell Lightning Bolt inflicts 24/4, i. e. 24 TBLP and 4 to each location. If the spell hits someone with MAC 1 then they only suffer 18/3 damage.

### Advantages of MAC
It offers protection from Spells and it will apply to any blow made by a magical weapon which does
not have a physical component. You don’t even need to be conscious to benefit from it.
