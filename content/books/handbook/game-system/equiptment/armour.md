Armour
Below are listed the cost of purchasing armour in grulls. The cost of armour is calculated by the actual AC it grants.
E.G. Mastercrafted AC 2 costs the same as AC 4

| Body Armour| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
Head | 20 |  40| 60| 80| 100| 120| 140|  160| 
Chest or Abdomen| 30| 60| 90| 120| 150| 180| 210| 240|
Upper or lower legs / arms| 10| 20| 30| 40| 50| 60| 70| 80|
Complete Suit| 160| 320| 480| 640| 800| 960| 1120| 1280|

*For example: A complete suit of light chain mail, which grants AC 4 and lasts for 5 adventures, costs 640 Grulls, where
as a complete suit of Master crafted light chain mail, which grants AC 6 and lasts for 10 adventures, costs 960 Grulls.*

**NOTE**: The armour cost listed is for Human armour. Some races have difficulty with acquiring armour and it may be
more expensive for them. Where this is the case it will be noted against the details of the race that this is so.
