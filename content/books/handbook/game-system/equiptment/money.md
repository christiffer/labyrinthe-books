# Money ~ Grulls

The in-character currency of The Empire is the grull, which comes in denominational notes from 10G to 5000G in value.

A day's adventuring will earn you between a couple of hundred and a few thousand grulls, depending on your level. This could be in the form of pay from the merchant who hires you to rescue his daughter, or treasure looted from an ogre's horde. Grulls can be spent on:

- [Armour]()
- [Spell Glyphs]()
- [Making potions]()
- Making [Magical]() or [Spiritual]() scrolls
- Making Supernatural Items such as magic swords and talismans of supernatural power
- Buying scrolls
- Buying healing potions
- Bribing monsters, paying other players to watch your back, paying the troll to let you cross his bridge and any other things you can come up with on your adventure.

Any physical object that you buy with grulls such as armour or potions still requires you to provide an actual physical representation (abbreviated to as a Phys-rep) as what you will get when you hand over your money is an official card stating precisely what it is that your character owns. These cards can be traded with other characters, in fact some things, notably potions or scrolls, are almost only available by such trade.
