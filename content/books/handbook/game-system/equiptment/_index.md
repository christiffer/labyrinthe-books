# Costume, Weapons & Equiptment
For your first few visits we can provide you with basic equipment by the way of weapons. We don’t provide costume
unless you are monstering, we simply don’t have enough to go round. However for your first few visits its not that
th
important – we would ask that you try to wear plain old clothes without 20 century logos on, which you don’t mind
getting a bit dirty or chalky. We do recommend that you get hold of a basic costume quite quickly as it is a very good aid
for role-playing. Bear in mind that you will be running round in a cave and we recommend that as well as old grubby
clothes that you don’t mind getting chalky and bringing a torch is also a good idea!
You’ll also discover the advantage to having your own weapons and equipment as you quite quickly develop a feel for
the types of weapon you prefer. Also weapons of your own will invariably be of a superior quality since we can only
provide basic weapons. Please note that we cannot provide bows. We do however sell weapons made by experienced,
professional, makers of very high quality.
As a First Level Character you only have the most basic of adventuring equipment that you do not need to purchase, this
means a weapon relevant to your class.
