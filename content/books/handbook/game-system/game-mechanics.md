# Game Mechanics
## Hand In The Air
A monster, or even a player, with his hand in the air is deemed not to be present in some fashion. They may be not
currently playing a part, or being a part, which is invisible, or hidden, or supernaturally travelling (referred to as shifting)
from one location to another. It generally means that you cannot interact with them and you should ignore their presence
and not react to them in any fashion – roleplay as if you are not aware of them.
## Time In
Play starts and the game is live. You become your character. Monsters can attack you. You are expected to speak,
behave, react and think as your character. The better you do this the more fun you’re going to have and the more fun
the people around you are going to have.
## Time Out
This is when game play stops. You can relax and be your self again. Usually this signifies the end of a section of
Dungeon, or the referee is going to call a break to Battleboard. You can usually sit down and relax.
## Time Stop
The game is ‘paused’ immediately when Time Stop is called. When the ref wants to give a specific description he will
call a Time Stop. During a Time Stop you stay where you are, keep quiet and listen to what is said. Some abilities
possessed by a character may allow them to call a time stop and take action.
## Time Freeze
The game is ‘paused’ immediately when Time Freeze is called, but you are also required to close your eyes and wait.
Something instantaneous has happened, perhaps an explosion or a creature appearing. The referee might want to be
able to check who is affected or to explain what has happened or to re-arrange your surroundings et cetera. Sometimes
your referee may even ask you to hum to mask the sounds of what he or the monsters are doing.
## Battleboarding
Battleboarding is when the referee makes a list of what powers you have used and what damage or effects you may
have suffered at the hands of the opposition. On the average dungeon this is usually done in a Time Out situation. You
need to relate everything that affects your stats that you did or that happened to you and this must be listed in the same
order that it happened. This can be very important, especially if you forget to mention that halfway through the fight the
Priest healed you! Correct battleboarding is very important to game play and a certain amount of trust that the player will
correctly battleboard is required. Referees do tend to keep an eye on players during combats to see if they own up to
the blows they took in a combat....
## Time Faff
Time Faff was invented by referees of their own accord some years back, and is now a generally accepted convention on
adventures. During Time Faff the game is still continuing, but players are expected to find reasons to remain where they
are and not to initiate any combats – they can continue to talk and roleplay, or similar. The purpose of Time Faff is to
allow the referee or monsters to prepare further encounters ahead without having to ask the party to stop roleplaying and
suspend the game.
