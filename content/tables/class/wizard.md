# Wizardly Post 8th Abilities

## Table 1

|Ability|Description|Cost|Available To|
|---|---|---|---|
| Innate Spells | Wizard or Warlock may elect to learn some of their spells innately, such that they can be cast without any mana point cost, but still with any associated life point cost.  Only handbook or basic spells that are already known by the spell caster may be chosen, and they must be either of their own colours or grey - a Red Wizard cannot learn Dancing Venom Sword innately, or even Disintegrate (range).  A Grey Wizard may select different spell innates from each colour already known, whereas a Warlock may select offensive spells from those already known.| 8pts / mp / day | Wizard, Warlock|
